🚀 Featured Projects & Case Studies

1. Automated Supply Chain Reporting System

The Problem: Manual consolidation of high-volume monthly Excel reports across multiple markets took 4+ hours with high human error risk.

The Solution: Architected a centralized Power BI Data Model with automated Power Query ETL pipelines to ingest raw ERP exports.

The Result: Reduced processing time to <15 minutes and achieved 99.8% data accuracy.

2. Logistics Volumetric Analysis Model

The Problem: No standardized method to calculate Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEU) from mixed container types (20ft, 40ft, 40HQ) for international shipments.

The Solution: Built a custom Power Query transformation logic to parse shipment data and auto-calculate TEU volume based on container type. Implemented Data Integrity Checks to filter duplicate line items automatically.

3. High-Volume Order Reconciliation Tool

The Problem: Manual verification of 200+ Purchase Orders against master price lists was time-consuming and prone to fatigue errors.

The Solution: Developed a VBA-based automated checking tool that validates PO line items against the master database in seconds.
